    <string name="info_name">About</string>
    <string name="info">\tThe reason we made this app is to help people
        plan new, eco friendly diets in hopes of reducing greenhouse gas
        emissions and meeting Metro Vancouver\'s goal of becoming the greenest
        city in the world by 2020.
        \n\nWhat Contributes to Greenhouse Gases?
        \n\n\tGreenhouse gases are measured in CO2e (or CO2 equivalents) and there are
        many CO2e contributors. Most people are aware of contributors such as
        burning fuel and natural gas, but it comes as a surprise to many that
        food production and transportation (livestock in particular) accounts
        for 20% of a person\'s greenhouse gas emissions!
        \n\n\tWhat Can We Do?
        \n\n\tWe can be more aware of what we eat and change our diets to reduce greenhouse
        gas emissions, and it does not even have to be an extreme dietary change. If people
        in the Metro Vancouver area reduced their beef/lamb consumption by 20% and replaced
        it with chicken, Vancouver could save up to 1 million tonnes of CO2e per year!
        \n\n\tWhere Does the Green Food Challenge Come In?
        \n\n\tThe Green Food Challenge aims to reduce our individual and collective carbon
        footprints by raising awareness and making it easy for users to adopt more
        environmentally friendly, lower carbon diets. Simply enter an estimate of how much
        meat and alternatives you eat and the app will make new, eco-friendly diets for you
        to choose from. It\'s that easy, so what are you waiting for?
        \n\n\tLet\'s get saving!</string>
