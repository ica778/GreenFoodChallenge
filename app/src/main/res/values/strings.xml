    <string name="info_name">About the Green Food Challenge</string>
    <string name="info">\tThe reason we made this app is to help people
        plan new, eco friendly diets in hopes of reducing greenhouse gas
        emissions and meeting Metro Vancouver\'s goal of becoming the greenest
        city in the world by 2020.
        \n\nWhat Contributes to Greenhouse Gases?
        \n\n\tGreenhouse gases are measured in CO2e (or CO2 equivalents) and there are
        many CO2e contributors. Most people are aware of contributors such as
        burning fuel and natural gas, but it comes as a surprise to many that
        food production and transportation (livestock in particular) accounts
        for 20% of a person\'s greenhouse gas emissions!
        \n\n\tIt does not even take a major dietary change to significantly reduce
        greenhouse gas emissions. If people in the Metro Vancouver area reduced
        their beef/lamb consumption by 20%, Vancouver could save up to 1 million
        tonnes of CO2e per year!
        \n\n\tIn an effort to reduce our carbon footprints, the Green Food
        Challenge aims to raise awareness and encourage others to adopt lower
        carbon diets.</string>
